\chapter{Introduction}

zxweather is software for automatic weather stations. It is licensed under the GNU GPL making it free software. Its main features are:
\begin{itemize}
\item A modern HTML5 web interface
\item Basic HTML fallback for older browsers.
\item Full weather history
\end{itemize}

This manual provides instructions to install and configure all components of the system. These are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Database
\item Data logger
\item Web interface
\end{itemize}

It is recommended that you read this manual in its entirety. It is the only documentation for installing and configuring all of zxweather.

\section{Supported Hardware}
At this time only weather stations 100\% compatible with the Fine Offset WH1080 are supported.

\section{System Requirements}
All components of zxweather are supported under modern versions of both Linux and Windows. It is recommended that Linux be used if possible however.

PostgreSQL v9.0+ is the only supported database engine. Other RDBMS such as MySQL are not supported in any way. Older versions of PostgreSQL may work but have not been tested.

The data collection tools are only supported on little-endian CPU architectures at this time. This includes Intel IA32 (x86) and most ARM processors. Bad things will happen if your processor is big-endian.

\subsection{Data logger}
The data collection tools are written in the C language and are portable to both Linux and Windows.

ECPG (a PostgreSQL utility), GCC and GNU Make are required to compile the software. To run it, libecpg and (on linux) libusb-1.0 are required.

\subsection{Web interface}
The web interface requires Python version 2.7 with the following packages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Jinja2
\item web.py
\item psycopg2
\end{itemize}

Additionally, gnuplot must be available on the system running the weatherplot program.

\end{tabular}

\chapter{Database}
\label{cha_database}
% Instructions for how to setup the database. This includes permissions
% required, etc.

This chapter describes the database setup required by zxweather. The database is required by the core system and is not optional. It must be setup on a system that all other components have network access to.

\section{Installation}

%TODO Come up with a better database setup system. Write a python program or something.

The zxweather database has only been tested with PostgreSQL version 9.0 and above. This documentation assumes you already have a suitable version of the server and client tools installed on your system.

This section documents creating the zxweather using the command-line PostgreSQL tools. If you are more comfortable with the pgAdmin III GUI tool you may use that instead.

\subsection{Create Database}
To create the weather database, execute a command such as the following:

\begin{verbatim}
$ createdb -h dbserver -U username weather "Weather database"
\end{verbatim}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{dbserver} is the hostname (or IP Address) of the machine running PostgreSQL.
\item \emph{username} is the username to login to the server with. This will often be something like "postgres". The account being used must have the \emph{CREATEDB} permission.
\item \emph{weather} is the name of the new database.
\item \emph{"Weather Database"} is a description of the database. This is optional.
\end{itemize}

More information on the createdb program can be found at \url{http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/app-createdb.html}.

\subsection{Create Database Structure}
The database structure needed by zxweather to store data is created using the \verb|database.sql| located in the \emph{database} directory of the zxweather distribution. Running this SQL script will create the full database structure in one step.

You can run this script with a command such as the following:
\begin{verbatim}
$ psql -h dbserver -U username -d weather -f database.sql 
\end{verbatim}
This command must be run from inside the database directory. The supplied parameters are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{dbserver} - The hostname (or IP Address) of the machine running PostgreSQL
\item \emph{username} - The user account to login to the server with. Using a superuser account (often called "postgres") will be easiest.
\item \emph{weather} - The name of the database you created in the previous section.
\end{itemize}

\section{Permissions}
Four programs will be accessing the database. They require user accounts with the following permissions on the weather database:

\begin{tabular}{l l}
\hline
\textbf{Program} & \textbf{Permissions} \\
\hline
wh1080d & CONNECT, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE \\
wh1080 & CONNECT, SELECT, INSERT \\
weatherplot & CONNECT, SELECT \\
web interface & CONNECT, SELECT \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

You can create individual accounts for each program or have them all sharing the same account.

%TODO Instructions for creating the accounts

\chapter{Data Logger}
% Compiling and installing wh1080d or the other program

Before starting the wh1080d program you must perform a full data load if any of the following conditions are true and your database is not empty. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|wh1080| - The WH1080 Update Tool
\item \verb|wh1080d| - The WH1080 Update Service
\end{itemize}

The \emph{Update Tool} allows you to inspect configuration and data on the device (including exporting it as CSV or inserting it into the database). It is useful for performing some maintenance tasks and troubleshooting.

The \emph{Update Service} runs continuously feeding both samples and live data into the database for use by other programs. This program runs as service under Windows or a daemon under Linux.

These tools are covered in more detail by the \emph{WH1080 Utilities Users Guide, version 1.0} (\verb|DAZW-WG01|).

Use of these tools requires that the database has already been setup. If you have not done this yet consult chapter \ref{cha_database}.

\section{Compiling}
This section only covers compiling the tools under Linux. If you are using Microsoft Windows it is recommended that you use the pre-compiled executables and skip to the next section.

\subsection{Requirements}
To compile the tools under Linux the following software must be installed:
\begin{itemize}
\item GNU Make
\item GNU C Compiler
\item ECPG (a PostgreSQL utility)
\end{itemize}

The following libraries are also required:
\begin{itemize}
\item libpq (PostgreSQL client library)
\item libecpg (library for ECPG)
\item libusb-1.0
\end{itemize}

These libraries and software packages should be available from your operating systems package manager. On Debian 6.0 the packages would be \verb|build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev libecpg-dev|.

\subsection{Compiling the WH1080 Tools}

%TODO Switch to the GNU Build System and rewrite this.

To compile the WH1080 tools, cd into the wh1080 subdirectory of the zxweather distribution and run \verb|make|. This should kick off the build process and leave you with a handful of programs.


\section{Loading Data}

Before you can start the update service it is important to note that you may have to run a \emph{Full Update}. It is important to do this to do this when necessary to prevent:
\begin{itemize}
\item Corrupt data being inserted into the database
\item New data on the weather station from being lost
\end{itemize}

However, if the a Full Update is performed when it is \emph{not} necessary it will result in duplicate samples being inserted into your database.

\subsection{When to perform a Full Update}
There are only three occasions when it is acceptable (and necessary) to perform a full update:
\begin{itemize}
\item You have just erased the weather stations memory
\item You have reset the weather station
\item The database is more than 4080 samples out of date
\end{itemize}

The first two deal with the case where the sample the database says needs to be downloaded next no longer exists on the weather station. This prevents invalid data from being inserted into the database.

The third deals with the case where the sample the database says needs to be downloaded next is not correct because \emph{all} samples needed to be downloaded. Failing to perform a full update in this case will likely result in some of the samples being missed

As an example, if your weather station is set to take one sample every five minutes then the database must be more than 340 hours out of date (that is a little over 14 days).


\subsection{Performing a Full Update}
To perform a full update you must use the \emph{Update Tool} as the Update Service can not perform this operation.

The \verb|-l| command-line option causes the Update Tool to perform a Full Update instead of a regular one
