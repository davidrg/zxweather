      stations memory. Failure carry out the procedure described when required
      may result in data loss.

      happens the WH1080 Update Service will become unresponsive. If this
      happens it must be terminated manually before resetting the weather
      station.
    * If the WH1080 Update Service looses its database connection it will exit.
