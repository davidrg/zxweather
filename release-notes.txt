===============================================================================

  zxweather is a system for collecting and displaying data from automatic
  weather stations 100% compatible with the FineOffset WH1080 or Davis Vantage
  Vue. It includes:

    * A Modern HTML5 web interface with a fallback for older browsers.
    * A desktop client for Windows and Linux to display current conditions.

  Note this is the first beta release of version 1.0. It has not received
  extensive testing and may contain bugs. If you encounter any problems first

  Supported Platforms:
    All components of zxweather are supported under both Linux and Windows.
    Linux is the recommended system for running the server components. The
    WH1080 data collection tool requires a little-endian CPU such as Intel x86
    and most ARM processors.

  Software Environment Requirements:
    * PostgreSQL 9.x
    * Python 2.7
    * gnuplot
    * For compiling WH1080 Utilities: GNU C, GNU Make, ECPG, libecpg,
      libpgtypes, libpq, libusb-1.0 (linux only, binaries are available for
      windows systems)
    See the Installation Reference manual for a full list of all dependencies
    that must be installed on systems running the various zxweather components.

  Known Issues:
    * It is important to consult section 3.2 of the Installation Reference
      Manual (DAZW-IG02) before restarting the WH1080 Update Service after
      extended down time, a weather station reset or erasing the weather
      stations memory. Failure carry out the procedure described when required
      may result in data loss.
    * The FineOffset WH1080 is known to crash from time to time. When this
      happens the WH1080 Update Service will become unresponsive. If this
      happens it must be terminated manually before resetting the weather
      station. This is a problem with the hardware and there is no known fix
      or workaround.
    * If the WH1080 Update Service looses its database connection it will exit.

  New in v1.0:
    General:
      * Support for weather stations compatible with the Davis Vantage Vue.
    Weather Server:
      New component. It is available over SSH, Telnet, a raw TCP socket as well
      as secured and unsecured WebSockets. It can update a database with new
      data received over SSH. It can stream data updates to clients connected
      on any protocol.
    weather-push:
      * Replaces db_push. Streams data updates to a remove weather server over
        SSH.
      * Numerous upgrades over db_push: more reliable, easier to configure,
        support for logging and runs as a daemon
    Desktop Client:
      * Chart plotting. These can be exported to PNG, JPG, BMP or PDF. Chart
        data can come from the database or web interface.
      * Davis hardware support.
      * Now shows wind direction as a compass point as well as in degrees
      * Proper Linux support
      * Supports receiving live data from the weather server via TCP
      * Bft description is now shown for wind speed
    Web Interface:
      * Supports streaming live data from the weather server using WebSockets
        on supported browsers. This updates data instantly without polling.
      * Davis hardware support
      * Basic UI now has 24-hour rainfall charts
      * When multiple stations are present in the database a menu is now present
        to switch between stations.
      * /s UI now uses the HTML5 Canvas charting library previously used by
        the /m UI.
      * The Google Visualisation API previously available as the /s UI is now
        the Alternate UI (/a) for older browsers
      * Old versions of Internet Explorer are handled better now.
      * Day level charts on the /s and /a station overview pages now show data
        for the last 24 hours rather than the current date.
      * Bft description is now shown for wind speed
      * A notification message can now be shown on station-level pages. This is
        configured through the admin tool and can be closed by the user (with
        the closed state being remembered).
    Weather-plot:
      * Now supports plotting charts for multiple stations
      * Performance has been improved significantly
      * Now supports multiple parallel gnuplot instances for extra performance
        on multiprocessor systems.
