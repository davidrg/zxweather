zxweather v0.2 (alpha) Release Notes                                      -2013
===============================================================================

  zxweather is a system for collecting and displaying data from automatic
  weather stations 100% compatible with the FineOffset WH1080. It includes:

    * A Modern HTML5 web interface with a fallback for older browsers.
    * A desktop client for Windows and Linux to display current conditions.

  Note that this is an alpha release. While it is functional it does have known
  minor defects and is not feature complete. If you encounter any bugs first
  check to see if there is a new release available. If you are running the
  latest release then please report the bug to bugs@zx.net.nz

  Supported Platforms:
    All components of zxweather are supported under both Linux and Windows.
    Linux is the recommended system for running the server components. The
    data collection tool requires a little-endian CPU such as Intel x86 and
    most ARM processors.

  Software Environment Requirements:
    * PostgreSQL 9.x
    * Python 2.7
    * gnuplot
    * For compiling WH1080 Utilities: GNU C, GNU Make, ECPG, libecpg,
      libpgtypes, libpq, libusb-1.0 (linux only, binaries are available for 
      windows systems)

  Known Issues:
    * It is important to consult section 3.2 of the Installation Reference
      Manual (DAZW-IG01) before restarting the WH1080 Update Service after
      extended down time, a weather station reset or erasing the weather
      stations memory. Failure carry out the procedure described when required
      may result in data loss.
    * The FineOffset WH1080 is known to crash from time to time. When this
      happens the WH1080 Update Service will become unresponsive. If this
      happens it must be terminated manually before resetting the weather
      station. This is a problem with the hardware and there is no known fix
      or workaround.
    * If the WH1080 Update Service looses its database connection it will exit.

  New in v0.2:
    * The desktop client can now retrieve data from the web interface as well
      as directly from the database.
    * Support for multiple weather stations logging to the same database
    * Limited support for viewing data from multiple weather stations in the
      web interface and desktop clients
    * Other weather station hardware types besides the FineOffset WH1080 are
      now supported provided the data can be loaded into the database. Loading
      the data requires writing or obtaining a third-party application (no
      software is supplied as part of zxweather to interface with other
      weather station hardware). See the zxweather Database Structure manual
      (DAZW-DB02) for details on doing this.
