TODO:
 * Command-line parameters (dump to CSV, dump to console, dump to postgres)
 * make the .pro file build under linux (use appropriate hidapi code and link
  against libusb)
 * Add Visual C++ 2010 project files
 * Add OpenWatcom project files if its compatible
 * Only use the history data stack value (not the data sets value as that will
   hit 8176 and stay there)
 * Ability to force a full update from the start. For use in the following
   situations:
     * Weatherstations memory has been wiped
     * Update hasn't been run in a long time so the latest record in the
       database no longer exists in the weather station.

New program - weatherd:
 * Read latest weather station record every 48 seconds and do a broadcast on
   postgres to say it has turned up
 * Load in new history records every interval minutes
