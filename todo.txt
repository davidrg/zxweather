TODO:
 * make the .pro file build under linux (use appropriate hidapi code and link
  against libusb)
 * Add Visual C++ 2010 project files
 * Add OpenWatcom project files if its compatible
 * Only use the history data stack value (not the data sets value as that will
   hit 8176 and stay there)
 * Rework programs to fit new memory limit (docs lie - there isn't space for
   8176 records)
 * Work out rainfall stuff

New program - weatherd:
 * Read latest weather station record every 48 seconds and do a broadcast on
   postgres to say it has turned up
 * Load in new history records every interval minutes
