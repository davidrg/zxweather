
wh1080 tools:
  - Set them up for GNU autoconf/automake
  - Allow the .pro files to build under linux (use appropriate hidapi code and
    link against libusb and libecpg)
  - Have a go at building with some other compilers under windows:
    - Visual C++ 2010
    - OpenWatcom
  - Add the ability to log raw data to csv files

Other software:
  - A web interface in python
  - a desktop app in C++/Qt
  - A new wh1080 tool to run as a daemon or windows service. It would:
     - feed live data into the system every 48 seconds
     - load a new sample into the database every x minutes (x = sample interval)
    this would also mean fewer clock syncs (just one on startup).
