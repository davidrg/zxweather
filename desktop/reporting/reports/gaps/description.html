<b>Data Gaps</b>
<hr>
<p>
    This report displays all gaps in the weather stations historical record
    along with their label if there is one.
</p>
<p>
    A gap is anywhere where the time between two consecutive samples is twice
    the sample interval or more. This indicates that at least one sample that
    should have been produced by the weather station was not or was not
    recorded.
</p>
<p>
    Possible causes for gaps include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data logger experienced an error downloading one or more samples</li>
    <li>Weather-Push hasn't replicated one or more samples yet</li>
    <li>
        Weather station failed to produce one or more samples due to being
        offline (no power, in setup mode, etc)
    </li>
    <li>Data deleted from the database</li>
</ul>
<!--<p>
    Any gap not marked as &quot;Known&quot; in the report results can affect
    the Desktop Clients ability to cache data for the month(s) containing the
    gap. If any of the reported gaps are known to be permanent (eg, station was
    offline for a period and the data will never exist) you can use the
    mark-gaps tool to mark these gaps as &quot;Known&quot; allowing the desktop
    client to permanently cache the non-existence of this data. The mark-gaps
    tool also allows you to give these gaps a label so you can keep a record
    of why there is no data available for each period.
