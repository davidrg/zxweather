<b>Sunrise & Sunset</b>
<hr>
<p>
    Calculates sun rise and set times for your chosen location and time zone
    as well as day length and solar noon time. Daylight savings will be handled
    automatically for the time zone chosen.
</p>

<p>
    A simple plain-text output similar to that provided by WeatherLink is also
    generated. Differences from the WeatherLink version are a DD/MM/YY date
    format instead of MM/DD/YY and the time zone is reported under its
    IANA time zone database name. Daylight savings is always automatic.
