<b>Leaf Wet Hours</b>
<hr>
<p>
    This report adds up the total number of hours leaf wetness met or exceeded
    a chosen threshold while a chosen temperature sensor fell within a
    particular range.
</p>
<p>
    Leaf Wetness values range from 0 (completely dry) through to 15 (maximum
    wetness). For the leaf wetness threshold, enter a value that represents
    when the foliage you're monitoring is wet.
</p>
<p>
    This report runs for all enabled leaf wetness sensors. The same wetness
    threshold and temperature range applies to all leaf wetness sensors.
