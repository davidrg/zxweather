<b>Data Gaps</b>
<hr>
<p>
    This report displays all gaps marked as permanent in the weather stations
    historical record along with their label if there is one.
</p>
<p>
    This station may have other gaps in its data set that have not been marked
    as permanent. These will be visible in graphs, etc, but will not appear in
    this report.
</p>
<p>
    To display all data gaps including those that have not been marked as
    permanent, adjust your Data Source settings to use the Weather Database as
    your Sample Data Source rather than the Web Interface.
