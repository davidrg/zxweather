<b>Sunshine Hours</b>
<hr>
<p>
    Calculates hours of bright sunshine by comparing readings from the
    weather stations solar sensors to the calculated maximum solar radiation
    based on the stations location and the time of year.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the numbers produced by this report are not a true count of
    sunshine hours but rather an approximation. To calculate real sunshine
    hours a proper Sun Recorder is required.
</p>
<p>
    This report implements two algorithms for calculating maximum solar
    radiation. Each algorithm takes a parameter which you may wish to
    adjust for your location. Additionally the threshold altered to 
    control how close the solar radiation sensors must be to the calculated
    maximum for it to be considered bright sunshine. The <em>Raw Data</em> output
    produced by this report may be useful in fine-tuning these parameters.

<b>Outputs</b>
<hr>

<p>The report produces the following outputs</p>

<h4>Daily Sunshine Hours:</h4>
<p>Total sunshine hours by day with expected sunshine and a sunshine percentage sorted descending. Links to plot each day are provided as well as links to the images for each day (where images exist)</p>

<h4>Daily Sunshine Hours (grid):</h4>
<p>Same data as in the table in the <em>Daily Sunshine Hours</em> output but without the totals row at the bottom.</p>

<h4>Plain Text:</h4>
<p>Same format as the Weather-Link Bright Sunshine Hours report (but with a more sophisticated algorithm behind the numbers). Output is mostly the same as the <em>Daily Sunshine Hours</em> output but without the percentage and in plain-text.</p>

<h4>Raw Data:</h4>
<p>This is the underlying raw data - one row per sample.
    Columns are Start Time, Solar Radiation, Max Solar Radiation, Sunshine Hours.
    This data is mostly useful when adjusting the report algorithm parameters.
    Includes only the first 1000 rows of date.
