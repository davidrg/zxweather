<b>Soil Temperature Hours</b>
<hr>
<p>
    Soil temperature hours can be used to select a time to plant based on
    the portion of time that soil temperature is above freezing (or any other
    threshold).

<p>
    While this report is available for all weather stations and temperature
    sensors it is best used with a Davis Vantage Pro2 equipped with a #6345
    Leaf &amp; Soil Transmitter and a #6470 Soil Temperature probe.
