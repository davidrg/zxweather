<b>Records</b>
<hr>
<p>Calculates station records. These are high/low values over all of the weather stations data set.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you are using the <em>Web Interface</em> as the Sample Data Source this report will require downloading all station data which may take a little while. The data will be cached so next time the report is run it should be quicker.
