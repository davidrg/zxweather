zxweather Import/Export tool
===============================================================================

  The tools in this directory are for exporting data from one weather database
  and importing it into another. You can export all data or only a portion
  of it between two timestamps either with or without any associated images.

  Exporter:
    python export.py localhost weather postgres password ./exported
        --station sb --start "01-JAN-2018" --end "01-MAR-2018" --include-images

    If a start time is not specified then all data from the earliest sample or
    image will be exported. If an end time is not specified then all data from
    the start time (if specified) to the last sample or image will be exported.

    If a station code is not specified then all stations will be exported.

    Images will only be exported if the --include-images flag is specified.

    Note that the export tool is only compatible with zxweather v1.0.0 or newer
    databases.

  Importer:
    python import.py localhost weather postgres password
        ./exported/sb/station.json --start "01-FEB-2018" --end "15-FEB-2018"
        --include-images

     If a start or end time is not specified then earliest and latest samples
     are used instead as the start and end time. Only one station can be
     imported at a time. If --include-images is not specified then images will
     not be imported.

     If the station does not exist in the destination database it will be
     created. If any samples to be imported already exist in the destination
     database they will be automatically skipped (data that already exists in
     the database will not be modified).

  The import tool will expect the following directory structure:
    \station.json
    \samples.dat
    \{image-source-code}\{n}.json   (where n is some number)
                        \{n}.jpeg   (or other extension depending on MIME type)
