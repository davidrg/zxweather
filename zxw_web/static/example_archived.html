<!-- title: Station Archived -->

<!-- ---------------------- Example Archived Station Page ----------------------
This is an example "archived station" page. If you've got an archived weather
station and would like to put a bit more detail on its "station archived" page
than the date and a short message you can:
  1. Copy this file into the folder for your station and rename it to
     "archived.html". So if you're station code is "rua" then copy it to:
     ./rua/archived.html
  2. Set the title in the comment at the top of this file to whatever you'd like
  3. Replace the rest of the files content with whatever you'd like

Whenever the overview page for your archived station is requested this page will
be served up instead of the default archived station page!

If you want to keep the year list in the provided Weather History section you
need to put the code for your station into the block of javascript!
-->
    <h1>Station Archived!</h1>
    <p>
        This is where you can put some information about the station. When it
        was archived, why, etc.
    </p>

    <!-- With the help of some JavaScript this will show a list of links to each
     year the station was operating. For it to work you'll need to add
     -->
    <section id="history">
        <h2>Weather History</h2>
        <p>Weather data recorded by this station while it was operating
            remains available. You can browse this data at the day, month or
            year level starting from your desired year:<br>
