# Site configuration
# default_ui      - The default user interface to use if someone requests the
#                   root directory (that is, / instead of /s/station/)
# site_name       - The name of your site. Like "Davids awesome weather stuff"
# site_root       - Site root including hostname, etc. Used for redirects.
# static_data_dir - Location on disk where static data (images, css, PNG 
#                   charts, etc) is stored. Everything in here is made
#                   publicly available.
# station_name    - The code for the weather station you want to be the
#                   one users see by default. Consult the Installation
#                   Reference Manual for more details.
# disable_alt_ui  - If the alternate UI (using the Google Visualisation API)
#                   should be disabled

# The alternate UI (/a) uses the Google Visualisation API to produce its charts.
# This API is only available online (google doesn't allow self-hosting it). This
# means the alternate UI *requires* an internet connection and be able to access

# without internet access (or very expensive internet) its probably best to
# disable this UI by uncommenting the following line.

# Images are identified by timestamp, type and source. Each image in the
# database must have a unique combination of these three values. Images for an
# image source are sorted first by timestamp, then by type, then by title. This
# list controls how image types are sorted. Image type codes not in this list
# are all given the same sort order. An empty list results in images being
# sorted by timestamp and title only. If 5 images all have the same timestamp
# (perhaps they're different enhancements of a satellite image) they'll be
# sorted according to this list and then by their titles.
