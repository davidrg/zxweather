CHANGES                                             zxweather alpha release 0.2
===============================================================================

  Version 0.2 (alpha)
    New Features:
      - Support for multiple weather stations in the same database
      - Database is no longer specific to FineOffset WH1080 hardware. Other
        hardware types can now be supported by writing programs to import their
        data into the database. See the zxweather Database Structure manual
        (DAZW-DB02) for more details.
      - New administration tool to manage creating and upgrading the database
        as well as managing station configuration data now stored in the
        database.
      - Desktop client:
        - Settings will be loaded from zxweather-desktop.ini if the file exists
        - Settings dialog is shown on first run
        - Now supports retrieving data from the web interface for when a direct
          connection to the database is impractical.
    Bug Fixes:
      - Fixed bug where certain live data download timestamps could cause error
        messages in the zxweather desktop client.
    Other Changes:
      - Database refactored to make supporting different types of weather
        station hardware easier.
