CHANGES                                            zxweather release 1.0 beta 1
===============================================================================

  Version 1.0 beta 1
    New Features:
      - New weather server daemon which can stream data over raw TCP, a
        WebSocket or via Telnet and SSH.
      - New Weather Push utility to replace the old db-push tool. Weather Push
        sends data to the weather server via SSH
      - Support for the Davis Vantage Vue weather station (other Davis weather
        stations should work too).
      - Support for drawing charts in the desktop interface
      - Data sources can be specified separately for live data and chart
        samples. Samples can come either from the database or by downloading
        monthly tab-delimited data files from the web interface generated by
        weatherplot.
      - Desktop client can now receive live data from the weather server
      - Desktop client now shows wind direction as a compass point as well as
        in degrees
      - Desktop client now officially supports Linux systems.
      - Desktop client shows additional data available from Davis hardware when
        connected to a davis weather station.
      - Web interface can now stream live data instantly via a web-socket from
        the weather server
      - Basic web interface now contains 24-hour rainfall charts
      - Weather-plot can now plot charts for multiple stations in each run
      - The web interface now provides a menu to switch between stations when
        more than one station is present in the database. The order in which
        the stations appear is stored in the database with the station config.
      - Battery warnings for Davis hardware are shown in the web interface on
        the station overview page
      - The web interface standard UI (/s) now uses a faster and more
        interactive charting library that relies on the HTML5 Canvas element.
        The Google Visualisation API has been made the Alternate UI (/a)
      - Browsers that do not support the HTML5 Canvas element will be shown
        a warning message indicating they should switch to the alternate UI.
      - Users of Internet Explorer 8 will get a warning message on the Standard
        UI indicating that it is not supported by their browser and that the
        alternate UI may perform badly. They are given the option of switching
        to either the Basic or the Alternate UI.
      - Users of Internet Explorer 8 are now required to click an
        'Enable Charts' button in a warning panel of each page containing
        charts in the Alternate UI. The warning panel contains a message about
        the performance problems they are likely to encounter by clicking the
        button and a second button to switch to the Basic UI.
      - Users of Internet Explorer 5, 6 or 7 are redirected instantly to the
        Basic UI as the JavaScript and CSS does not work correctly in these
        browsers.
      - New system info resource: /data/sysconfig.json
      - Day-level charts on the modern station overview page now show data
        for the last 24 hours rather than the current date. Several new
        data sources were added for this.
      - Live data table now contains some data send down as part of the initial
        request. It is no longer empty until the javascript kicks in.
      - BFT description is now shown for current conditions wind speed in the
        desktop and web interfaces.
      - Weather-plot performance has been improved significantly
      - Weather-plot can now use multiple gnuplot processes to further improve
        performance.
      - A message can now be displayed in the web interface (basic UI excluded)
        for each station. This is turned on through the admin tool.
      - Basic interface now handles archive mode
      - All pages now have UI switch links at the bottom right of the page.
      - Ability to control live data timeout warnings
    Bug Fixes:

      - Fixed links in the desktop client about window opening in the about
        window instead of the default browser
      - WH1080 trigger functions could not handle multiple stations in the
        database
    Other Changes:
      - Gnuplot data files generated by weatherplot are now tab-delimited
        rather than having columns separated by several spaces This shaves off
        56 bytes per record.
      - Gnuplot data files now contain rainfall data
      - Dew point, apparent temperature and rainfall are rounded to 1dp in
        gnuplot data files to reduce size.
      - New data source in the web interface which supplies the range of
        samples available for a particular station
      - Fixed about dialog icon in desktop client
      - Removed "gust wind speed" from live data in web interface and desktop
        client.
      - Rearranged current conditions and records tables in the web interface
        so rows line up. All tables should use the same ordering now.
      - Upgraded admin-tool to support upgrading databases to v1.0. Older
        versions of the admin-tool have been blacklisted from v1.0 databases.
      - Timestamp column on sample table is no longer nullable
      - Removed db_push and associated web services in web interface.

        heading. Rainfall information has been moved into the day charts
        section.

      - Removed "Whats This?" button from desktop interface about dialog.
      - Fix "Whats This?" button in the desktop interface settings dialog.
      - Dygraphs upgraded to the latest version and fixed problems with rainfall
        chart. Labels are now drawn under the chart

      - Upgraded to bootstrap 2.3.1 (from 2.0.3)
      - Upgraded to jQuery 1.9.1 (from 1.7.2)
      - The station overview page in the basic interface now shows current
        conditions like in other interfaces
      - Basic interface HTML is a little more valid

  Version 0.2 (alpha)
    New Features:
      - Initial support for multiple weather stations in the same database
      - Database is no longer specific to FineOffset WH1080 hardware. Other
        hardware types can now be supported by writing programs to import their
        data into the database. See the zxweather Database Structure manual
        (DAZW-DB02) for more details.
      - New administration tool to manage creating and upgrading the database
        as well as managing station configuration data now stored in the

        - Settings will be loaded from zxweather-desktop.ini if the file exists
        - Settings dialog is shown on first run
        - Now supports retrieving data from the web interface for when a direct
          connection to the database is impractical.
      - When there has been no data for the past two days the web interface
        will enter archive mode where the station overview page just displays
        a message and links to each year in the database. The top navigation
        menu items are cut down to just 'Home' and 'About' in this mode.
    Bug Fixes:
      - Fixed bug where certain live data download timestamps could cause error
        messages in the zxweather desktop client.
      - Fixed problems with invalid data from the weather station
      - Fixed bug navigating between years
    Other Changes:
      - Database refactored to make supporting different types of weather
        station hardware easier.
      - Most applications will check the version of the database before running
        to prevent malfunctioning on databases that are too old or new.
